Prioritized Action Plan


This table represents the highest-priority, expert-curated action plan. It aggregates all "Decisive Red" and "Red" alerts from the entire report, transforming the 100-page analysis into a 1-page tracking document. Items are sorted by business risk and urgency.


Priority
	Rating
	Section (Linkable)
	Finding (Anonymized)
	Actionable Recommendation (with SAP Note)
	1
	Decisive Red
	10. Security
	Critical SAP HotNews [3xxxxxx] ("Known Exploitation Vulnerability") is not implemented in the `` system.
	Immediate Action Required. This is a non-negotiable, P1 security risk.5 Apply SAP Note [3xxxxxx] in an emergency change cycle as per SAP Security Best Practices.6
	2
	Red
	5. Hardware Capacity
	The SAP HANA Memory Forecast indicates that the index server on [hana_host_01] will reach its effective allocation limit in 19 days.
	Critical System-Down Risk. This is a proactive warning of an out-of-memory (OOM) dump.3 Business Decision Required: (A) Immediately execute the archival/deletion plan (See Section 15) to free up 1.5TB of memory, OR (B) Approve emergency hardware expansion.
	3
	Red
	16. Expensive SQL
	SQL statement hash [hash_1] (from ``) consumes 18% of total database time.
	High-priority tuning required. First: Search for hash [hash_1] in SAP Note 2000002 for known solutions.8 Second: Engage ABAP team to correct the SELECT * on table ``.
	4
	Red
	9. SAP System Operating
	Number range object `` (Financial Documents) is 95% exhausted. Predicted exhaustion: 14 days.
	Critical Business-Down Risk. This is a functional stop, not a performance issue.7 When this range is full, no new financial documents can be created. Immediate Action: Engage the business process team to approve and implement the number range extension.
	5
	Yellow
	7. Performance Overview
	Avg. Dialog Response Time (1150ms) exceeds the 1000ms "Yellow" reference threshold.9 Root cause is high DB Time (850ms).
	Performance is degrading. The bottleneck is the database. Action: This alert is a symptom. The causes are identified in Priority 3 (Expensive SQL) and Priority 6 (Stale Statistics).
	6
	Yellow
	13. Database Administration
	Optimizer Statistics for 15 large tables in the `` database are stale (older than 30 days).10
	This is an "invisible" performance killer. Stale statistics cause the DB optimizer to choose inefficient plans, creating expensive SQL. Action: Run a full update of database statistics. This may resolve a portion of the "Expensive SQL" findings (Priority 3).
	

A Note on "Grey" Rated Sections


A "GREY" rating in any section, particularly in Section 3, indicates that data collection failed.1 This is not a "pass"; it is a critical monitoring failure. A "GREY" rating in Section 3 means the system is "flying blind," as the performance data in Sections 6, 7, 8, and 17 is incomplete or stale.9 This report currently has Green data quality; however, if Section 3 ever becomes "Grey," resolving that data collection failure becomes the singular priority, superseding all other performance tuning.


2 Landscape


This section provides the context for the entire report. The system's landscape (e.g., S/4HANA vs. ECC, HANA vs. Oracle) dictates which best practices, SAP Notes, and alert thresholds are relevant for the analysis.13

System & Component Details:
This landscape composition is the "analysis filter" for this report. For example:
* The S/4HANA 2023 component 52 activates the importance of Section 14: Financial Data Quality, a critical check for S/4HANA migrations and operations.14
* The HANA DB component dictates the specific checks in Section 12: Database Performance, focusing on in-memory statistics rather than traditional disk I/O or buffer caches.16
* The ST-PI version (listed in Section 4) dictates the quality of data collected for Section 16: Expensive SQL.17

II. Foundation and System Health


This cluster of topics analyzes the foundational stability and configuration of the system. Failures in this area are the root cause of most performance and stability issues.


3 Service Data Quality and Service Readiness


This section is the "health check of the health check." It verifies that the EWA report's own data collectors are configured correctly and providing complete, accurate data.11 The overall rating for this section must be Green for the rest of the report's performance metrics to be trusted.9
Overall Rating for this Section: GREEN
Visual 3.1: Data Quality Checklist
* Graph Type: Minimalist Checklist
* Description: A clean checklist showing the status of the EWA's key data sources.
* Data:
   * [✓] Service Data Control Center (SDCCN): Green. Data transfer to SAP Solution Manager is successful.19
   * [✓] Diagnostics (SMD) -> BW: Green. Data from the Diagnostics Agent is flowing correctly into the Solution Manager BW, ensuring performance data is accurate.9
   * [✓] Workload Monitor (ST03): Green. Weekly workload statistics are complete.21
   * [✓] Service Preparation (RTCCTOOL): Green. The necessary toolsets (ST-PI, ST-A/PI) are present and at a sufficient patch level to collect all required data.1
The "Green" rating in this section is a critical prerequisite. A "Red" or "Yellow" rating here 11 would imply a "contamination" of the entire report. Specifically:
* A failure in Diagnostics (SMD) -> BW 11 would render the performance graphs in Section 7 (Performance Overview) 9 and Section 8 (Trend Analysis) 12 meaningless, as they are based on this data.
* A failure in RTCCTOOL 20 or an outdated ST-PI add-on (identified in Section 4) can cause entire sections, like Section 16 (Expensive SQL), to be missing.17
* Because this section is Green, the findings in the subsequent sections can be trusted as an accurate reflection of the system's state.


4 Software Configuration for


This section analyzes the system's core software components against SAP-recommended patch levels and maintenance schedules.20 Maintaining an up-to-date software stack is not merely a "housekeeping" task; it is the most effective proactive measure to prevent performance issues, data-collection gaps, and security vulnerabilities.
Overall Rating for this Section: YELLOW
Visual 4.1: Component Compliance Dashboard
* Graph Type: Horizontal Bar Chart
* Description: A clean bar chart comparing the Current Patch Level (grey bar) of key components against the SAP Recommended Level (purple target line). Bars that fall short of the line are color-coded (Yellow/Red).
* Data:
   * SAP Kernel Release: [Current: 7.xx Patch 450] | `` (YELLOW) 13
   * ST-PI Add-on: | (YELLOW) 1
   * HANA DB Client: [Current: 2.x.xx] | `` (GREEN)
   * SAP_BASIS: `` | [End of Mainstream Maintenance: 31.12.2027] (GREEN) 20


Analysis and Recommendations


The "Yellow" rating here for the SAP Kernel and the ST-PI add-on is a significant finding. These components are often the root cause of symptoms that appear elsewhere in the report.
1. Outdated SAP Kernel: An outdated kernel can contain bugs in database communication, memory management, and performance. The performance issues identified in Section 7 (Performance Overview) and Section 16 (Expensive SQL) may be symptoms of this outdated kernel. SAP Best Practice is to apply the latest consolidated kernel patch before engaging in expensive, time-consuming custom code tuning.
2. Outdated ST-PI: The ST-PI and ST-A/PI add-ons contain the data collectors for the EWA itself.1 A "Yellow" rating here means the system is not running the latest collectors. This can lead to known data-collection issues, such as the missing Expensive SQL section (a common problem 17) or bugs in how data is read from the database.25
Actionable Recommendation: A "catch-up" project for the SAP Kernel and ST-PI components should be scheduled. This is a proactive measure that may resolve other "Yellow" and "Red" performance alerts by fixing known, underlying bugs.


5 Hardware Capacity


This section analyzes the consumption of the two primary hardware resources: CPU and Memory.26 This analysis is critical for both tactical bottleneck identification and strategic capacity planning.
Overall Rating for this Section: RED
Visual 5.1: CPU Utilization (4-Week Trend)
* Graph Type: Dual-Line Chart (Apple-style)
* Description: A clean line chart showing the 4-week trend for average and maximum CPU utilization on the application servers.
* Data:
   * Average CPU: Trending at 45% (GREEN)
   * Maximum CPU: Peaking daily at 75% (GREEN)
* Analysis: CPU resources on the application servers are healthy and not a bottleneck.
Visual 5.2: Memory Utilization (4-Week Trend - Application Servers)
* Graph Type: Line Chart
* Description: A line chart showing the 4-week trend for memory utilization and paging on the application servers.
* Data:
   * Memory Utilization: Stable at 60% (GREEN)
   * Paging/sec: 0 (GREEN)
* Analysis: Memory on the application servers is healthy.
Visual 5.3: SAP HANA Memory Forecast (Index Server)
* Graph Type: Predictive Line Chart
* Description: A predictive forecast chart showing the Mean, Best-Case, and Worst-Case scenarios for HANA Index Server memory exhaustion.3 This is the report's most valuable predictive alert.28
* Data:
   * Current Usage: 4.2 TB / 5.0 TB (84%)
   * Effective Allocation Limit: 4.8 TB
   * Worst-Case Exhaustion Date: 19 Days (RED ALERT)


Analysis and Recommendations


The "Red" rating for this section is one of the most critical findings in the report. The "HANA Memory Forecast" 3 is a proactive warning of a near-future, catastrophic system-down event. When the index server breaches its effective allocation limit, it can lead to table unloads (severe performance degradation) or "Out-of-Memory" (OOM) dumps (system outage).3
This technical alert must be escalated to a business-level decision. There are two paths to resolution:
1. The Tactical Path (Cost): Approve an emergency hardware purchase to increase the server's RAM. This is a short-term, expensive fix that buys time.
2. The Strategic Path (TCO Reduction): This hardware crisis is a symptom of a data management problem. Section 15 (Data Volume Management) of this report identifies 1.5TB of "Archivable" data in the top 10 largest tables.
Actionable Recommendation: The organization has a 19-day window to prevent a system outage. An immediate, high-priority project must be initiated to execute the archiving and deletion recommendations detailed in Section 15 (DVM). This will strategically reduce the data footprint, free up memory, and push the exhaustion date back, all while reducing the system's Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).29 This is the SAP-recommended "best practice" approach.

III. Performance and Workload Cluster


This cluster analyzes the system's workload profile ("what" the system is doing) and its performance ("how well" it is doing it). These sections are interdependent and must be read together.


6 Workload Overview


This section analyzes the system's "personality," or workload profile, based on data from the ST03 Workload Monitor.31 Understanding this profile provides the essential context for evaluating the performance metrics in Section 7.
Overall Rating for this Section: GREEN
Visual 6.1: Workload by Task Type
* Graph Type: Minimalist Donut Chart (Google-style) 32
* Description: A donut chart showing the percentage of total workload (transaction steps) broken down by task type.9
* Data:
   * Dialog: 55%
   * RFC: 30%
   * Batch: 10%
   * HTTP(S): 5%
* Analysis: This is a classic "Dialog-heavy" ERP system profile, with a significant RFC (interface) load. This profile means that the Avg. Dialog Response Time (from Section 7) is the single most important metric for end-user satisfaction. The high RFC load also warrants a closer look at the "RFC Load by Initiating Action" table.
Visual 6.2: Top 10 Applications (by Response Time)
* Graph Type: Horizontal Bar Chart
* Description: A Chart.js bar chart showing the top 10 applications (transactions or reports) that consume the most total response time.31
* Data:
   1. `` (18% of total time)
   2. `` (12% of total time)
   3. `` (9% of total time)
   4. ...


Analysis and Recommendations


This section provides the "context" for the performance analysis in Section 7. The workload profile (55% Dialog) confirms that end-user-facing transactions are the lifeblood of this system. Therefore, the "Yellow" alert for Avg. Dialog Response Time in Section 7 (1150ms) is a significant finding that directly impacts user productivity.
The "Top 10 Applications" list identifies `` as the primary consumer of system resources. This report is the first place to look for tuning potential and is directly correlated with the "Expensive SQL" finding (Priority 3) in the Executive Summary.
The "RFC Load by Initiating Action" sub-check 18 shows that 80% of the RFC load (30% of total workload) is coming from an external ``. If RFC performance becomes a bottleneck, this external system is the source.


7 Performance Overview


This section evaluates the workload identified in Section 6, comparing its performance against SAP's predefined "Reference Times".9 This is where the root cause of performance bottlenecks is typically found.
Overall Rating for this Section: YELLOW
Visual 7.1: Response Time Breakdown (Dialog Task)
* Graph Type: Stacked Bar Chart
* Description: This is the most important diagnostic chart for performance. It shows the Avg. Dialog Response Time and what components contribute to that time.9
* Data:
   * Total Avg. Response Time: 1150 ms (Breaches 1000ms "Yellow" threshold 9)
   * Breakdown:
      * Avg. Database Time: 850 ms (74% of total time)
      * Avg. CPU Time: 200 ms (17% of total time)
      * Avg. Wait/Processing Time: 100 ms (9% of total time)
Visual 7.2: Performance vs. Reference (Dialog)
* Graph Type: KPI Gauge
* Description: A gauge showing the Avg. Dialog Response Time (1150ms) against the "Green" (<800ms) and "Yellow" (>1000ms) thresholds.2
* Data: The needle is firmly in the "Yellow" zone.


Analysis and Recommendations


The "Stacked Bar Chart" (Visual 7.1) provides an immediate, unambiguous diagnosis for the "Yellow" performance rating. The system is not slow due to application server CPU (200ms is excellent) or hardware constraints (Section 5).
The system is slow because the database is slow.
The Avg. Database Time of 850ms is the "smoking gun." It accounts for 74% of the end-user's response time and is the sole reason for the 1150ms total. A healthy, tuned system should have a DB Time contribution closer to 40-50%.
This finding immediately directs the analysis to the database-focused sections of this report. The root causes for this high DB Time are not in this section; this section provides only the symptom. The causes are found in:
1. Section 16 (Expensive SQL): The `` (Priority 3) is a known contributor to this high DB time.
2. Section 13 (Database Admin): The "Stale Statistics" (Priority 6) are causing the optimizer to make poor decisions, inflating the DB time for many queries.10
Actionable Recommendation: Do not "tune the app server." All performance optimization efforts must be focused on the database. The action plan defined in the Executive Summary (Priority 3 and 6) directly addresses the root causes of the high DB Time identified here.


8 Trend Analysis for


This section provides a short-term, micro-level trend analysis, sourced from the Solution Manager BW.12 It answers the question: "Are my specific, key applications getting slower week-over-week?" This is distinct from Section 17, which provides a long-term, macro-level view of the entire system.
Overall Rating for this Section: YELLOW
Visual 8.1: Application Profile Trend (Top 3)
* Graph Type: Multi-Line Chart
* Description: A 6-week response time trend for the "Top 3" applications identified in Section 6.12
* Data:
   * `` (Line 1): Stable at ~700ms (GREEN)
   * `` (Line 2): Stable at ~400ms (GREEN)
   * `` (Line 3): A clear upward-trending line, moving from ~3500ms (6 weeks ago) to ~5800ms (this week) (YELLOW).


Analysis and Recommendations


This section provides a critical insight into "creeping degradation." While `` is already a known issue from Section 6 and 16, this trend chart shows that the problem is getting worse. A 5% or 10% degradation each week is often invisible in the weekly average (Section 7) until it's too late. This chart provides the proactive warning.
The degradation of is likely due to data growth. As the tables it reads () get bigger each week, the inefficient SELECT * (identified in Section 16) takes progressively longer. This trend line provides a powerful business case to the development team to prioritize the fix for this report, as its performance is actively degrading.


9 SAP System Operating


This section analyzes the system's operational stability, focusing on errors and critical resource availability.13
Overall Rating for this Section: RED
Visual 9.1: Stability KPI Trends (Last 7 Days)
* Graph Type: Daily Bar Chart
* Description: A 7-day bar chart showing the daily count of ABAP Dumps and Update Errors.18
* Data:
   * Update Errors: 0 (GREEN)
   * ABAP Dumps: 45 total. A spike of 40 dumps occurred on 05.07.2024.
* Analysis: The ABAP Dumps were not a recurring daily issue but a single "spike" event. An investigation of the ST22 log for 05.07.2024 should reveal the root cause (e.g., a bad data import or a specific user action).
Visual 9.2: Critical Number Range Exhaustion
* Graph Type: KPI Gauge
* Description: A gauge showing the percentage used for the most critical number range nearing exhaustion.2
* Data:
   * Object: `` (Financial Documents)
   * Percent Used: 95%
   * Predicted Exhaustion: 14 Days (RED ALERT)


Analysis and Recommendations


This section contains a P1, "Business-Down" alert.3 The "Red" rating for the `` number range (Priority 4 in the Executive Summary) is a critical functional risk.
* Unlike a performance issue, which makes the system "slow," this issue will make the system "stop."
* When this number range is exhausted, users will be functionally unable to create new financial documents. This halts the core business process.
* This is not a technical issue for the Basis team to fix alone. The solution (extending the number range) requires approval and coordination with the Financial business process owners.
Actionable Recommendation: This alert must be immediately escalated to the IT Director and the
Finance business process owner. This is a time-sensitive, collaborative action that must be resolved within the 14-day window to prevent a P1 business outage.

IV. Security and Change Management


This cluster analyzes system risk, compliance, and governance. Failures here represent significant audit and business-process risks.


10 Security


This section details the system's security posture, based on checks from SAP Note 863362.6
Overall Rating for this Section: RED (Decisive)
Visual 10.1: Security Alert Dashboard
* Graph Type: KPI Card Grid (Color-Coded)
* Description: A set of cards highlighting the status of the most critical security checks.7
* Data:
   * Missing SAP HotNews: 1 (DECISIVE RED) 5
   * Default Passwords Active: 0 (GREEN) 6
   * Users with SAP_ALL: 12 (YELLOW) 5
   * ABAP Password Policy: Active (GREEN) 35


Analysis and Recommendations


This section is the cause of the report's overall "RED" rating.
1. Decisive Red - Missing HotNews: The alert for a missing SAP HotNews 5 is the single most urgent, non-negotiable finding. This means the system is exposed to a known, published, and high-priority exploit. This is not a theoretical risk; it is an active vulnerability. This is Priority 1 in the action plan.
2. Yellow - Critical Authorizations: The finding of 12 users with the SAP_ALL profile 5 is a significant finding that represents two distinct forms of risk:
   * Security/Audit Risk: It violates the principle of least privilege and is a major finding in any internal or external audit.
   * Financial/TCO Risk: Users with SAP_ALL are often automatically classified as "Professional" users, which is the most expensive license type. An audit of these 12 users to determine if their access is truly required is not just a security best practice; it is a cost-optimization opportunity.
Actionable Recommendation:
* Immediate: Implement the missing SAP HotNews [3xxxxxx] per the action plan.
* Short-Term: Initiate a user-access review for the 12 SAP_ALL users. This action serves both security/audit compliance and potential license cost reduction (TCO).


11 Software Change and Transport Management of


This section analyzes the health and hygiene of the Change and Transport System (CTS), which is the foundation of system governance and code deployment.18
Overall Rating for this Section: YELLOW
Visual 11.1: Transport Health KPIs (Last 7 Days)
* Graph Type: KPI Card Set
* Description: A set of cards showing the count of critical transport errors in the last week.15
* Data:
   * Transport requests with import errors: 0 (GREEN) 15
   * Overtakers and bypassed transport requests: 2 (YELLOW) 15
   * Emergency Changes (Created in PRD): 0 (GREEN) 15


Analysis and Recommendations


The "Yellow" alert for "Overtakers and bypassed transport requests" is a critical finding that points to a broken change management process.
* An "overtaker" means an old version of an object (from Transport A) was imported after a newer version of the same object (from Transport B), effectively overwriting the new code with old code.15
* This action re-introduces bugs that were already fixed, creating a "boomerang" effect where the development team must fix the same problem twice.
* This is not a technical failure but a governance and process failure. It indicates that transports are not being managed in the correct sequence, or that the transport buffer is not being properly coordinated.
Actionable Recommendation: This alert is a direct indicator of process failure. An immediate audit of the transport release procedures and buffer management for the `` landscape is required to prevent code regression, production instability, and wasted development effort. If this data is ever missing, it is critical to check the Diagnostics configuration as per SAP Note 1265070.39
________________


V. Database and Data Management Deep Dive


This cluster provides a focused analysis of the data layer, which was identified in Section 7 as the primary performance bottleneck.


12 Database Performance


This section provides a deep dive into database-specific KPIs. As `` runs on HANA, the checks are specific to in-memory operations.16
Overall Rating for this Section: GREEN
Visual 12.1: SAP HANA Memory Usage Overview
* Graph Type: Donut Chart
* Description: A breakdown of the HANA Index Server's memory utilization.41
* Data:
   * Column Store Tables: 75%
   * Row Store Tables: 5%
   * Caches & Temp/Intermediate Storage: 15%
   * Other: 5%
* Analysis: This is a healthy distribution for an S/4HANA system. The majority of memory is correctly allocated to the Column Store.
Key HANA Check Status:
* HANA Merge Errors: 0 (GREEN) 42
* Log Backups: Successful, running every 15 minutes (GREEN) 25
* HANA Service Uptime: 45 days (GREEN)


Analysis and Recommendations


This section's "Green" rating is a crucial finding. It tells us that the high DB Time (from Section 7) is not caused by a "sick" or misconfigured database. The HANA database itself is healthy: merges are running, backups are complete 16, and memory is correctly allocated.
This "process of elimination" is a core diagnostic technique. If the database platform is healthy (Section 12), but the database performance is poor (Section 7), the problem must lie in what is being asked of it. This pivots the analysis with 100% confidence to the SQL statements being executed (Section 16) and the data statistics (Section 13).


13 Database Administration


This section analyzes database operations, housekeeping, and preventative maintenance.40
Overall Rating for this Section: YELLOW
Visual 13.1: Top 5 Tablespace/Data Volume Growth
* Graph Type: Bar Chart
* Description: A bar chart showing the largest data volumes and their growth.
* Data:
   * : 1.2 TB (+50GB/week)
   * : 800 GB (+30GB/week)
   * : 400 GB (+10GB/week)
* Analysis: The database growth is significant but consistent with an active S/4HANA system. This data is the primary input for Section 15 (DVM).
Key Administration Check Status:
* Database Backup Status: Last full backup successful (GREEN) 16
* Optimizer Statistics: 15 large tables have stale statistics (YELLOW) 10
* Tablespace Overflow: No tablespaces are at risk of overflow (GREEN) 27


Analysis and Recommendations


The "Yellow" rating for Optimizer Statistics is a high-priority finding (Priority 6 in the Executive Summary). This is an "invisible" performance killer.
* The database query optimizer is the "brain" that decides the most
efficient path to get data (e.g., which index to use).
* It makes this decision based on Optimizer Statistics 10, which tell it how large tables are and how data is distributed.
* If these statistics are stale (a "Red" or "Yellow" alert), the optimizer's "brain" is working with old, incorrect information. It will make bad decisions, such as choosing a "full table scan" instead of a "fast index lookup."
* This causes a normally fast SQL statement to become "expensive," which in turn causes the "Expensive SQL" alerts in Section 16 and the high DB Time in Section 7.
Actionable Recommendation: An immediate job to update database statistics must be run. This single administrative action may resolve multiple "Expensive SQL" alerts without requiring any code changes. This is a classic example of how a failure in "Administration" (Section 13) manifests as a "Performance" problem (Section 7 & 16).


14 Financial Data Quality


This section is a specialized check, critical for all S/4HANA systems, that analyzes the consistency and integrity of the financial data (e.g., General Ledger and Fixed Assets).14
Overall Rating for this Section: YELLOW
Visual 14.1: Data Inconsistency Dashboard
   * Graph Type: KPI Card Set
   * Description: A set of cards showing the count of data inconsistencies found by the reconciliation reports.14
   * Data:
   * General Ledger Inconsistencies: 1,240 (YELLOW)
   * Fixed Assets Inconsistencies: 85 (GREEN)
   * Reconciliation Run (FIN_CORR_RECONCILE): Run 2 days ago (GREEN) 14


Analysis and Recommendations


This "Yellow" alert, while not an immediate system-down risk, is a significant finding for the business. These 1,240 inconsistencies in the General Ledger mean that certain financial reports may be inaccurate, or that data reconciliation at month-end is more difficult.
For a system already on S/4HANA, this points to a flaw in a custom enhancement, an interface, or a data migration that was not fully resolved.
   * For a system migrating to S/4HANA, these checks are a "project-stopper." The S/4HANA migration cannot complete until these inconsistencies are manually analyzed and resolved.14 The presence of these alerts in an ECC system serves as a critical early warning for a future migration project.43
Actionable Recommendation: The output from the FIN_CORR_RECONCILE report 15 must be provided to the functional finance team and ABAP team. These 1,240 inconsistencies need to be analyzed, categorized (e.g., as "Manual Correction Required" or "Fixable via Report"), and resolved to ensure the integrity of financial reporting. SAP Note 2714344 provides guidance on resolving these manual issues.14


15 Data Volume Management (DVM)


This section analyzes the volume of data, its growth, and the potential for reduction through Avoidance, Summarization, Deletion, and Archiving.30
Overall Rating for this Section: GREEN (Rated "Green" as data is present, but contains critical recommendations)
Visual 15.1: Database Growth Trend (12-Month)
   * Graph Type: Line Chart
   * Description: A 12-month trend of the total database size, with a predictive forecast line.46
   * Data:

   * Data:
   * Total Savings Potential: 1.5 TB (30% of total DB)
   * Top Savings: 700 GB from (data > 3 years old), 400 GB from (data > 180 days).


Analysis and Recommendations


This section provides the strategic solution to the tactical crisis identified in Section 5 (Hardware Capacity).
   * The Problem (Section 5): The HANA server will run out of memory in 19 days.28
   * The Solution (Section 15): This report identifies exactly 1.5 TB of "Savings Potential".45
This is not "housekeeping." This is a "mission-critical" stability and TCO-reduction action.29 The recommendation is clear and urgent:
Actionable Recommendation: Initiate the DVM project for (Archiving) and (Deletion) immediately. This is a direct counter-measure to the "Red" alert in Section 5. Executing this 1.5 TB reduction will proactively avert the memory exhaustion crisis, stabilize the system, and reclaim expensive HANA memory, thereby reducing TCO.


16 Database server load from expensive SQL statements -


This section is the "hit list" for database performance tuning.17 It lists the Top SQL statements that are causing the high DB Time (850ms) identified in Section 7. If this section is missing, it is typically an issue with an outdated ST-PI add-on.17
Overall Rating for this Section: RED
Visual 16.1: Expensive SQL Load
   * Graph Type: Treemap
   * Description: A treemap visualizing the relative "cost" of the top SQL statements. The size of each block represents its percentage of the total database load.33
   * Data:
   * [hash_1] (from ``): 18% of load
   * [hash_2] (from SAP_PROGRAM): 9% of load
   * [hash_3] (from ``): 7% of load


Top 5 Expensive SQL Statements (Action List)


This table is the worklist for the DBA and ABAP development teams.


Priority
	SQL Statement Hash (Anonymized)
	ABAP Program Origin
	% of DB Load
	Analysis & Recommendation
	1
	[hash_1]
	``
	18%
	Action: This custom report uses a SELECT * on table ``. This is a non-sargable query.50 Modify the ABAP code to select only the required fields.
	2
	[hash_2]
	``
	9%
	Action: This is a standard SAP program. First: Search for hash [hash_2] in SAP Note 2000002.8 This Note provides known solutions for expensive standard SAP SQL. This transforms a "tuning" task into an "apply Note" task.
	3
	[hash_3]
	``
	7%
	Action: This query is slow due to a missing secondary index on table `` for field [field_x]. This is confirmed by SAP Note 3203951.51 Create the recommended index.
	4
	[hash_4]
	``
	5%
	Symptom: This statement is expensive. Cause: This is a symptom of the "Stale Statistics" identified in Section 13.10 Action: Do not tune. First, update statistics (Priority 6). This alert will likely disappear.

VI. Long-Term Outlook




17 Trend Analysis


This is the macro, long-term (Year-over-Year) trend analysis section.12 It is distinct from Section 8. This dashboard is for strategic capacity planning and budgeting. It tells the "strategic narrative" of the system's health by correlating its workload, performance, and size over time.18
Overall Rating for this Section: GREEN
Visual 17.1: The "C-Suite" KPI Dashboard (24-Month Trends)
   * Graph Type: Three Minimalist Line Charts (Apple-style)
   * Description: Three line charts aligned on the same 24-month X-axis, allowing for visual correlation of macro trends.
   * Data:
   1. Total System Workload (Transaction Steps): A steady, linear growth of +15% Year-over-Year.
   2. Avg. Dialog Response Time (ms): Was flat at ~750ms for 18 months. In the last 6 months, it has begun a "hockey stick" curve, rising to the current 1150ms.
   3. Total Database Size (GB): A steady, linear growth of +30% Year-over-Year (matches DVM data).


Strategic Narrative and Analysis


These three charts, when read together, tell a clear and urgent story. This is not a "Healthy Growth" scenario. This is Scenario B: The "Hockey Stick" Inflection Point.
   * For 18 months, the system's architecture and tuning could absorb the linear growth in workload and data.
   * Six months ago, the system crossed an "inflection point." The linear growth in data (Chart 3) and workload (Chart 1) began to exponentially degrade the user-facing response time (Chart 2).
   * This visual evidence proves that the system as currently configured can no longer scale. The current performance issues (Section 7) are not temporary; they are the "new normal" and will only get worse.
Conclusion: The technical alerts (Expensive SQL, Stale Stats, Memory Growth) are all symptoms of this larger, strategic problem. The system has reached its scaling limit. The recommendations in this report (DVM, SQL Tuning, Stats Update) are no longer just "optimizations"; they are critical interventions required to bend the performance curve (Chart 2) back down and allow the system to continue handling the business's growth (Chart 1). This dashboard provides the definitive business case for prioritizing these technical projects.
